[Rotary encoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder) look a bit awkward on the modern devices which we usually used to control from touchscreens. But I found it more convenient and intuitive to use rotary encoder for volume control than touchscreen. The latter is good for visual feedback of your rotary encoder actions. Also when the touchscreen is in screensaver mode and volume control UI component is not visible then rotary encoder is also is the best way to change the volume.
