The genre can be selected on the Genre screen. Three things happen upon this selection: 

1. Player switches to the corresponding playlist. 
2. The previously saved station for the selected genre will be loaded from the configuration file.
3. Player switches to Station screen and starts playing the station selected in the previous step.
