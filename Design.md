Any design starts from sketches and finishes with ready-to-use schemes and diagrams. The sketches for the Peppy wooden case you can find in the [sketches](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy.doc/wiki/Sketches) chapter.

* Keep the case weight in the reasonable range. Solid wood is pretty heavy comparing to
* Provide holes for the passive ventilation system to cool electronic components.
* Make the case easy to assemble. Joining
* Make it transportable. Though it's 
* All parts of the case should be easily accessible to apply finish.
