### What is Peppy?
**Peppy** is the name of the audio player which contains three ingredients created from scratch for this project: [Hardware](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy.doc/wiki/Hardware), [Software](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy.doc/wiki/Software) and [Woodware](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy.doc/wiki/Woodware). Why Peppy? This is the first word which came to my mind when I tried to find out any word which would contain three **P** characters for **P**ython **P**ygame **P**layer. That reflects the fact that the software component was written in Python language using Pygame library.

Here are the key features of the Hardware component:
* It is based on popular single-board computer Raspberry Pi 2. This is the "heart".
* High quality audio achieved by using integrated DAC-Amplifier module HiFiBerry Amp+ and Sony speakers. This is the "voice".
* The Hardware have six "senses" to control its functionality:
    * Mouse
    * Keyboard
    * Touch-Screen
    * Infrared Remote Control
    * Rotary Encoders
    * Any computer in a local network or mobile device with Web Browser

Here are the key features of the Software component which represents the "brain":
* This is application written in Python. The cross-platform nature of Python allows to run Peppy on different platforms. It works fine on Windows and Linux.
* Peppy provides Graphical User Interface for audio players running in a headless mode. Currently Peppy supports only 'Mpd' audio player but it was designed in such a way that integrating with new player (e.g. Mplayer) should be pretty simple task.
* Embedded Web Server allows to control audio playback from any Web Browser. It was tested with Firefox, IE, Chrome and Safari. The GUI was written in such a way that it has the same look and feel on Touch-Screen and in Web Browser.
* The default screen resolution is 480*320. This is the resolution of the TFT used for this project. Though UI is dynamic and can scale to any screen resolution.
* Currently Peppy has only Internet Radio functionality. In the future releases support for playing audio files and streams will be implemented.
* By default Peppy has radio profiles for English, French, German and Russian languages. Each profile has multiple radio stations in different genres. Users can add their own stations to the playlists.

And finally the key features of the Woodware component:
* Original custom design.
* Made of wood (Cherry and Walnut).
* Natural finish - the variation of French Polish.

To give you the idea how Peppy GUI looks like here are several screenshots of the Peppy player.

###Enjoy!
I hope that the information presented here will be useful for DIY kind of developers. At least such tutorial could save me a lot of time and hair if I would have it when I started this project ;)
